## Introduction¶
Microsoft movie project seeks to ssek out relevant data which will be used by Microsoft in building a movie studio. The project focuses on Box Office Mojo, movie budgets and other movie information that has been used by other movie production companies.
After understanding the data, data will be cleaned to:removing any duplicates, Checking any missing data,Removing any irrelevant data. 
Thereafter Visualizations to present the data will be made to ensure it is easy to understand to the leader of microsoft.
## Problem Statement
Microsoft wants to get into the movie industry. However they don't know much about the industry. They therefore want a data scientist to evaluate the movie industry, to identify which movies are actually doing well at the box office hence providing them with actionable insights that the company, Microsoft, can use to determine the films they will major on.
## Main Objective
This project aims to help Microsoft's new movie studio make informed decisions about the types of films to create. By analyzing data from the film industry, insights and trends that will assist in identifying successful strategies for the studio can be uncovered.
## Specific Objectives
1. Identify the most successful movie genres that microsoft head will use to make a prompt decision on which type of movies to put more focus on. </br>
2. To visualize movie budgets (especially using the tn movie budgets file). </br>
3. Understanding how different branches of the entire movie field affect the company reputation and sequentials for thaat matter. E.g., rating, genre, runtime.

## Conclusions
There is a saying, "Put your money where your mouth is". Most movie productions seem to take up this quote to a high degree only investing on the movies which have the highest number of views. Thats why Drama views barely make it in the least (having a total domestic and worldwide gross of less than 5 million dollars). </br>
Certainly, there seems to have no significance difference from the domestic market to the worldwide market. That shouldn't be a factoe of determining the types of movies to focus on </br>
Also, just because a certain genre has a high box office that doesn't meant will have a high total gross (domestic gross + worldwide gross) e.g., Action and adventure|Mystery and suspense genre has the highest box office while Drama|Mystery and suspense take the second position. But when we compare the two when it comes to the total gross that each has earned, well, now the latter takes the top position while the former takes the fourth position. </br>
The more you invest the more you garner more gross profit. This is evident since most movies which have  high production budgets end up having high gross income.
## Recommendations
1 a). The head of microsoft should consider venturing into Drama|Mystery and suspense since they have the highest gross income. </br>
 b). The head of microsoft should combine that genre with Action and adventure|Mystery and suspense since they have the highest box office. </br>
2. He should consider investing heavily in production to get a high gross profit both domestic and worlwide. </br>
3. Hes hould never consider to produce PG movies since they have the lowest rating and the lowest total gross too.
